<p align="justify">KazanSummit 2013  – V International Economic summit of Russia and OIC countries will be held  October 2-3, 2013, in Kazan, Russia. KazanSummit is the only platform for  economic cooperation between Russian regions and the most developed countries  of the Islamic world.<br>
  This year KazanSummit 2013 will celebrate its first  anniversary - the fifth time the Summit will turn Kazan into the platform of  economic cooperation between investors, businesses and government.<br>
  The summit of  such scale is the only one in Russia and the CIS. It is jointly organized by  the Tatarstan Investment Development Agency and the Islamic Business and  Finance Development Foundation with support of the Federation Council of the  Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and under the patronage of the  Government of the Republic of Tatarstan.<br>
  First held in 2009, KazanSummit from the scientific  conference on Islamic finance has grown to a large international economic summit,  whose work promotes international relations of Russia and consistently promotes  the attraction of investments in its regions.<br>
  The Progress of KazanSummit is noticeable. One can look  just at the numbers: In 2009, 250 participants attended the summit, in 2010 –  400, in 2011 – 750, in 2012 - more than 1000 guests, over 30% of which came in Kazan  from around the world. <br>
  KazanSummit became a brand under which the Islamic  world supposes acquaintance with the potential of Russian regions where  cooperation with Islamic investors can get the most intensive development due  to the openness and versatility of business meetings and negotiations site.<br>
  Although KazanSummit has the main aim to promote the  development of economic and financial relations of the participants of business  activities in accordance with the requirements of Shariah, it does not mean  that the geography of the summit's participants is limited only to Muslim  countries. In 2012, out of 34 countries, which participated in KazanSummit, were  7 European countries, as well as South Korea, Hong Kong and the United States.<br>
  Every year the interest of Russian regions to the  international summit is also increasing. Last year, 13 subjects of Russia took  an active part in the events of KazanSummit, presenting their investment  potential in the framework of the Investment Forum.<br>
  It is important to note that since 2012 KazanSummit went  to a higher level thanks to the support of the Federation Council of the  Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation. Held last year within the framework  of KazanSummit 2012 conference of representatives of parliaments of the OIC  member countries identified a new aspect of the discussion within the framework  of international summit - the strengthening of intercultural dialogue between Russia  and OIC countries.<br>
  Thus, the concept of KazanSummit is getting wider and  offers an open dialogue between East and West. All activities are characterized  by a special atmosphere of benevolent interest in constructive discussion of economy  trends and work together to develop solutions. Business meetings are held in  the format &quot;without ties&quot;, which allows to discuss the prospects of  cooperation in the personal atmosphere of mutual interest of the parties.<br>
  That openness of KazanSummit, width of discussed and  covered topics, constructive dialogue and possibilities opened here attract the  participation of representatives of the government of Russia and foreign  countries, the heads of Russian regions, international investors and  industrialists, global business community, experts of banking and financial  institutions, scholars from Russia, OIC countries, CIS, Europe, Southeast Asia  and the Middle East.<br>
